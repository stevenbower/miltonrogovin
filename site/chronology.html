  <h1>Chronology</h1>
    <h2>1909</h2>
<p>Milton Rogovin is born in New York City, the third son of Jacob and Dora (Shainhouse) Rogovin. Jacob had emigrated from Lithuania in 1904, followed in 1905 by Dora and baby Sam, born in 1904; their second son, Louis, is born in 1907. The family runs a small dry-goods store on Park Avenue between 112th and 113th Streets in Manhattan.</p>
<h2>1920</h2>
<p>Business conditions worsen after World War I, and the Rogovin family moves their store to the Bay Ridge neighborhood in Brooklyn; Milton commutes to Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan.</p>
<h2>1927-1931</h2>
<p>Studies at Columbia University, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Optometry. Following the loss of the family's home and store after the onset of the Great Depression, Jacob Rogovin dies of a heart attack four months before Milton's graduation.</p>
<h2>1932</h2>
<p>As the Depression deepens, Milton begins to question why millions are unemployed. &ldquo;My real education began after I graduated from Columbia,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I could no longer be indifferent to the problems of people, especially the poor, the forgotten ones.&rdquo; He attends classes in political economy with instructors from the Workers' School, begins to read the Daily Worker and New Masses, and is introduced to the photographic work of Jacob Riis and Lewis Hine. In Manhattan, he works as an optometrist and becomes active in the Optical Union.</p>

<h2>1938</h2>

<p>Moves briefly to Niagara Falls and then to Buffalo, New York. In Buffalo, is a charter member of the United Optical Workers Local Industrial Union 951 of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).</p>
<p>Active in the American League Against War and Fascism, and participates in fundraising for ambulances and medical supplies in support of the Republican forces fighting fascism in Spain.  </p>
<p>At the wedding reception for one of his employer's daughters, meets Anne Snetsky (the family name is changed to Setters), born August 4, 1918. He initiates a conversation about the Spanish Civil War; she is initially uninterested in the topic, but her politics soon change.</p>
<h2>1939</h2>
<p>With Anne's encouragement, opens an optometric office on Chippewa Street in Buffalo that provides service primarily to the city's union members.</p>

<h2>1942</h2>
<p>
Milton and Anne marry on April 7.</p>
<p>Purchases his first camera.  </p>
<p>In November Milton volunteers and is inducted into the United States Armed Forces. Initially assigned to training as an X-ray technician for the Air Force, he is transferred to the ground forces and serves as an optometrist in the United States Army until 1945.</p>
<h2>1943</h2><p>
While attending X-ray training school in Indiana, wins first prize in a photography contest sponsored by the school with a photograph of a local waterfall.</p>

<h2>1944</h2><p>
Daughter Ellen born. Milton is denied his request to see Anne and Ellen before going overseas, and departs for England, where he works in a hospital in Cirencester.</p>

<h2>1945</h2><p>
Returns to Buffalo, where his brother Sam, also an optometrist, had been running Milton's optometric office while Milton was in the armed forces. Sam and Milton establish Consumers Eyesight Service as partners. Milton again becomes active in union and other political work, including voter registration in Buffalo's African American community. With the onset of the Cold War, Milton and Anne come under surveillance for their political activities.</p>

<h2>1946</h2><p>
Son Mark born.</p>

<h2>1947</h2><p>
Daughter Paula born.</p>

<h2>1950</h2><p>
As the Cold War intensifies, Milton and Anne actively protest the arrest of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, who are accused of spying for the Soviet Union. Anne works to raise money for the Rosenbergs' defense; the family is devastated when Ethel and Julius Rosenberg are executed in 1953.</p>

<h2>1953</h2><p>
Travels to Mexico with Anne and meets socially conscious Mexican artists; returns to Mexico intermittently through 1957 and begins his first serious photographic work.</p>

<h2>1957</h2><p>

Milton is summoned before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. He refuses to answer any questions other than his name and occupation, and in the Buffalo press is proclaimed "Buffalo's Number One Red." As a result of these attacks, his family is shunned and his optometric practice is severely curtailed. Anne refuses to sign the "Loyalty Oath" required for teachers in the Buffalo public schools, and is hired to work for the Board of Cooperative Education as a Special Education teacher.</p>

<p>Milton is invited by his friend William Tallmadge, a professor of music at State University College in Buffalo, to accompany Tallmadge while he makes recordings at a Holiness Church in Buffalo's African American community and to make photographs of the church services. His political voice virtually silenced, Milton realizes that through photography he can make people aware of social and economic inequities and of the problems of the poor. Tallmadge completes his work in three months; Milton works in the storefront churches of Buffalo for three years and produces his first social documentary series. The photographer Minor White offers advice on ways to effectively convey motion photographically, and introduces him to the use of the bare-bulb strobe that Milton will employ throughout subsequent photographic series. Through experience, and through White's critique, he matures as a photographer and solidifies his conception of his work as serial rather than individual images. The Storefront Church series marks the beginning of his commitment to social documentary photography, as a means of speaking about the struggles of the people he calls "The Forgotten Ones."</p>

<h2>1961</h2><p>

In October, Minor White publishes Milton's Storefront Church series, with an introduction by the eminent sociologist and civil rights leader W.E.B. DuBois, in <em>Aperture</em> magazine.

For this series he uses the twin-lens Rolleiflex camera that he will continue to employ throughout his photographic career.</p>
